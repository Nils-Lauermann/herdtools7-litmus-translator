\chapter{Standard Library\label{chap:StandardLibrary}}

In addition to the operations, ASL provides some standard functions.
The standard functions are available from the following address:
\url{https://github.com/herd/herdtools7/blob/ASLRefALP2.1/asllib/libdir/stdlib.asl}
\identi{KBLH}
The standard functions given there provide one way of implementing them.
ASL implementations can implement the functions in any way that provides equivalent behavior.

\verb|print| and \verb|println| are \printstatementsterm{},
and \verb|Unreachable()| is an \unreachablestatementterm{}, not standard subprograms.
